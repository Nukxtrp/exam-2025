				PROPOSAL 


I propose a webpage with a full home page containing a range of information spanning from what we do to what we sell and then have a navbar with a login system, a register system, a page where you can browse all the products that we sell and the prices for quotes on installation and servicing for the products there, a page with a carbon emission calculator so the users can calculate their carbon footprint and based on the inputted data it will output advice on how to reduce their emissions, also once you’ve logged in there will be 2 buttons on the navbar that shows up in place of the login/signup button one of which allows you to log out and the other sending you to a settings page that allows you to do things such as change your login details, change whether the page is in dark mode and finally a feature for accessibility where you will be able to change the text size for partial blindness or activate a colour blindness mode which which will change the colours to allow the colour blind to see the page properly.

Users that could benefit from this solution are:
People hoping to go green and looking at the options
People hoping to go green and wanting to know their carbon emission levels 
People hoping to go green and wanting to track their carbon emission levels 
People hoping to go green and wanting to see how much it would cost them
The elderly
The partially blind
The colour blind

Business context

We are very excited to announce our collaboration with Rolsa Technologies (an international leader in the green technology field) as they engage in such environmentally friendly initiatives as solar panel installations, car charging stations, and smart home energy systems. Their goal is to provide the best customer service while developing a state of the art commerce platform. This platform will serve as a guide to customers by giving them information in a way that is clear and to the point about green energy products while offering practical tips that are individualized according to their daily routine that exceed their carbon emission rate of the day. The software will also automate the process of scheduling consultations and installations as it will also provide tools to calculate and monitor carbon emissions.
This platform has the ability of featuring options such as account registration, energy usage tracking and complete accessibility to support all users. We are committed to realizing their vision and would be excited to be a part of the project that combines convenience and eco-friendliness.





Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:

Functional Requirements:
Information Delivery: The system should show information about the green energy currently on market and should provide information on how to reduce their carbon footprint .
Consult and Installation Scheduling: customers should be able to book consultations or installations directly through the website.
Carbon Footprint and Monitoring:The platform must include a tool for calculating the users carbon footprint. It should allow the user to save their track and monitor their carbon footprint over time.
Account management: The website should allow the user to register for an account. The website should allow the users to login to manage their consults, personal data and preferences.
Accessibility: the platform must include accessibility features such as text size adjustments and colour blind friendly modes.
Energy usage tracking: The website should include tools to help the user track and measure their energy usage.


Non-Functional Requirements:
User Interface and Experience: The website should provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
Performance: The website must be able to handle a number of users efficiently without any noticeable delay in response time.
Scalability: The website should be able to allow further growth including increasing the number of users at a time.
Reliability: The website should ensure consistent uptime and strong error handling mechanism.
Security: Customer data including personal information and energy usage information must be stored securely. The website should follow data regulation laws such as GDPR
Compatibility: The website should work seamlessly across various devices and operating systems. It should also support modern web browsers.
Maintainability: The codebase should be well documented to simplify maintenance and updates. Regular updates should be possible without disrupting the user experience.
Localisation: The platform should support multiple languages making it accessible to a diverse customer base.





Rational:
This project has been designed to provide Rolsa Technologies and its clients with a product that is easy to use as well as being practical and effective. The main object of this platform is to provide further understanding on sustainability. A page where customers can get all details about the different products Rolsa Technologies have, for example the installation of solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations, and energy saving systems for smart homes, also what would be the best option for them to make decisions quickly thanks to options available to them.
Containing a carbon emissions calculator is extremely important due to the fact it is not just a matter of throwing numbers at the clients rather it is about helping people to make the best choices to suit their needs and preferences. When customers see how they affect the environment and get useful advice on how to reduce their energy consumption they feel that they have the power to take decisive action. Adding functionality to schedule consultations and installations easily and therefore creating a practical tool makes it a platform that people can trust.
Accessibility is an important aspect of the platform design which is crucial in ensuring that it is user friendly. Whether it includes options for adjustable text sizes, color blind friendly features, or even a dark mode the platform aims to help all the people including but not limited to old people and the ones with specific needs such an approach embodies the previously mentioned principles of Rolsa Technologies.

The technical side is the main part where the proposal targets building a stable, secure, and scalable future for the company. Amongst the demanded functions are things like user registration and energy tracking. Those features clearly demonstrate the company’s urge to provide the customers with affordable reliability and long-term usability. With these morals and ideals the business creates a platform that has lasting, reliable power instead of just working only for a few months then requiring replacement.
